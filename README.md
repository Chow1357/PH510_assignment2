# Assignment 2 for PH510 
this assignment is to do with using object oriented programming for vector problems.
three tasks were completed using this code and the tasks varied from the creation of a vector class and basic real-value vector operations in task 1. Then using the objects in this vector class to find internal angles and the areas of triangles in task 2. The final task, focussed on vectors with complex variables and creating a new class that inherited from the parent vector class.
